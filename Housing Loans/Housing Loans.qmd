# Model Plan

I'm going to use this model to predict the likelihood of a home loan being approved for a borrower in Kent County, Michigan in 2023.

## Causal Diagram

![](Housing Loans.png)

Considering the causal diagram above, the response variable will be the number of loan approvals and the main predictor I'm most interested in is different races of the borrowers. I want to see if loan-to-value ratio and loan term will affect the probability of approving so I put both loan-to-value ratio and loan term as my moderators. Property could also affect loan-to-value ratio and loan term in some ways. Since it's binary data, we are going to use binomial family and logit link function. 

```{r}
hdma_kent_20 <- hdma_kent_20 |>
  # for case_when, each variable value gets a line of the form
  #  logical_condition_statement ~ new_value_to_assign
  mutate(action_taken = case_when(action_taken == 1 ~ 'Loan granted',
                                  action_taken == 3 ~ 'Loan denied'),
         action_taken = factor(action_taken))

mosaic::tally(~action_taken, data = hdma_kent_20)
```

```{r}
hdma_kent_20 <- hdma_kent_20 |> mutate(income = income / 100000)
hdma_kent_20 <- hdma_kent_20 |> mutate(property_value = property_value / 100000)
```

# Exploration
```{r}
gf_props(~action_taken| derived_race,
         data = hdma_kent_20)
```


```{r}
mosaic::tally(~derived_race, data = hdma_kent_20)
hdma_kent_20 <- hdma_kent_20 |>
  mutate(drived_race = fct_lump_min(derived_race, min = 200))
gf_bar(~derived_race, data = hdma_kent_20)
```
It's not very obvious but we can see that Asian, Black or African American, and Race not Available are slightly more likely to get denied on their application.     

# Fit the model
```{r}
model <- glmmTMB(action_taken ~ derived_race + loan_term + loan_to_value_ratio + property_value,
                 data = hdma_kent_20,
                 family = binomial(link = 'logit'))
summary(model)

```

# Assessment
```{r}
model_sim <- simulateResiduals(model)

gf_point(model_sim$scaledResiduals ~ rank(fitted(model))) |>
  gf_labs(x = 'Predicted Probability',
          y = 'Scaled Residuals')
```

The points are spread uniformly top-to-bottom so we have no indication that the mean-variance relationship departs from what is expected.If you zoom in to the graph you can see a pattern that most of the dots is in same vertical direction around x = 2500 area, I don't know if it has enough evidence to show the linear trend. 

```{r}
s245::gf_acf(~resid(model))
```

Most of the lines are inside of the bound so I would conclude that the independence of residuals condition is met. 

# Conclusions

## Model Selection
```{r}
car::Anova(model)
```

## Prediction Plot
```{r}
ggpredict(model, terms = 'derived_race') |>
  plot()
```

According to my model selection, it shows that derived_race has a very small p-value which means there is a correlation between action_taken and derived_race. From my model assessment, both independence of residuals and mean-variance relationship are met. At last, the prediction plot also shows that white people are more likely to get approved compare to other colored races.
